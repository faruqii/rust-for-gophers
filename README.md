### Introduction to Rust
Rust is a systems programming language focused on speed, memory safety, and parallelism. With Rustâ€™s ownership model and type system, it brings unique advantages and challenges for developers coming from Go. This guide will introduce Rust concepts by leveraging the knowledge you already have from Go.

### Setup
To get started with Rust, [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) by following the official installation guide.

```bash
# Install Rust and Cargo
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

After installing Rust, you can verify the installation by checking the version of Rust and Cargo.

```bash
# Check Rust version
$ rustc --version
```

### Creating a New Package
```bash
# Create a new package
$ cargo new package-name
```

### Running a Package
```bash
# Change directory to the package
$ cd package-name
$ cargo run
```
